          Although the Society for Modern English Research (SMER) was formally established in 2025, the spark that ignited 
          its formation had been smoldering for many years in the minds of visionary scholars devoted to advancing modern 
          English studies. The idea emerged from a collective realization that, despite significant progress in global 
          research on language, linguistics, and literature, there remained a pressing need for a dedicated platform that 
          could unify diverse voices, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and bridge cultural and academic boundaries 
          across continents.

          The founders envisioned an organization that would not only encourage innovative research but also ensure that 
          scholarly insights in modern English-language linguistics and literature are translated into meaningful academic 
          and social contributions. Over time, this vision evolved through informal collaborations, international dialogues, 
          and shared academic endeavors, gradually crystallizing into a structured global initiative—SMER.

          Its establishment in 2025 marks the realization of that long-nurtured dream: to create a non-profit scholarly 
          society that embodies inclusivity, intellectual freedom, and cross-border collaboration. Built upon the foundation 
          of academic integrity and accessibility, SMER represents a new era in modern English research—one that connects 
          researchers across nations, celebrates cultural diversity, and champions the transformative power of language and 
          literature in an ever-evolving world.
